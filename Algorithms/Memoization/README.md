# Memoization

Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs 
by **storing the results of expensive function calls** and returning the cached result 
when the same inputs occur again. Can also be thought of as *memorization*.

While memoization is great for decreasing time complexity, it increases spacial 
complexity.
