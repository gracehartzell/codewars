### Naive Sorts:

- Keep looping and comparing values until the list is sorted.
- Quadratic time; two loops involved
  - Bubble Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort

### Divide and Conquer Sorts

- Recursively divide lists and sort smaller parts of list until entire list is sorted
- `O(n log n)`
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
