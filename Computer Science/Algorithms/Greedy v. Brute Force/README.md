# Greedy v. Brute Force Approaches

## Greedy

- Takes short-sighted approach without looking at the big picture
  - Always make the **locally** optimal choice

Use: When dataset is so big that you can't think of an optimal solution

## Brute Force

- Calculate every single combination possible and keep track of the minimum.
- Depth of BF decision tree is the same as the number of decisions made
