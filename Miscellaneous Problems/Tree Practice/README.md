# Binary Search Tree Creation

In this repo, you will find a directory for test (which houses the test for the tree) and a template file for the creation of the tree. 

## How to Use:
#### If this was a standalone directory:
* Fork and clone
* Complete the following commands in your â€ erminal:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/gracehartzell/DIRECTORY-NAME
cd DIRECTORY-NAME
npm install 
npm test
```
<sup>*</sup>Instead of the dummy link, you'd copy+paste the actual SSH for the clone of the repository. 

Once you feel as though you've completed the tree exercise as best as you can (all tests should be passing at that point), go to the solutions branch and compare your work.
