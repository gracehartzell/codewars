# Binary Search Tree Creation

In this repo, you will find a directory for test (which houses the test for the tree) and a template file for the creation of the tree. 

## How to Use:
#### If this was a standalone directory:
* Fork and clone
* Complete the following commands in your â€ erminal:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/gracehartzell/DIRECTORY-NAME
cd DIRECTORY-NAME
npm install 

```
<sup>*</sup>Instead of the dummy link, you'd copy+paste the actual SSH for the clone of the repository.
