# Toy Problems Galore! 

This is my collection of toy problems that I'm accumulating as I grow and learn. First try dates are (occasionally) 
noted before the solution to each problem so that I can go back at some point and see how I've grown and been able 
to make my code more succinct.

**Please note that there are additional problems I've completed that haven't been added here yet.**

* Currently implementing a test suite into individual files in order to eliminate the use of `console.log` within the 
actual JS files and to get some practice with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).
