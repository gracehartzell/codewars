# Divide and Conquer

Recursive technique for taking a larger problem and breaking it into subproblems
and doing work on subproblems to reach some goal.

### Example: Binary Search
* Search for a value in a **sorted** array by cutting the side of the search in half. 
**Logarithmic time: cutting dataset in half every time**
